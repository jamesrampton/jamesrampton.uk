Hi, I'm James. Nice to meet you.

I'm a web developer, specialising in bespoke back-office systems and API integrations with Django.

I have a background in Government communications, so I enjoy proofreading and copy editing when I need some time away from code.

I'm also a photographer and musician; you can find some of my work dotted about this site.

My most recent sound design project was a collaboration with [Alan Jackson](https://speakersonstrings.com/wedo.html) for [Andy Baker](https://andybak.net)'s VR Kinetic Sculpture, *[Gossamer](https://andybak.net/gossamer)*. It's on display at the [Museum of Other Realities](https://www.museumor.com/artwork/gossamer). Alan and I created the soundtrack, and I assisted with the audio implementation in Unity.

I composed the soundtrack for [Chris Cory](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3923380/)'s short film, *[Crossing The Line](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655588/)* and was lead Composer and Foley Artist for his follow up, *[Behind the Eyes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4515036/)*.

Other musical projects and roles include Director of Music for [Charlie Swallow](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3911988/)'s stage production of Georg BÃ¼chner's *Woyzeck*.

I was Composer and Director of Music for performance art installations *Synchronicity* and *Synchronicity 2*, the latter composition for which was a collaboration with [Matthew Searles](http://matthewsearles.com) and Alan Stead (aka [Golden Elf](https://goldenelf.bandcamp.com)). (Sadly, these three projects don't seem to exist online anymore.)

Working for Government, I was Director of Photography, Camera Operator, and Voice Over Recordist for a short information film on [Anti-Social Behaviour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ADc-r4ub0).

I'll occasionally [write](/posts) here on subjects ranging from the above interests to anything else that tickles my fancy.

This site was hand built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), if you're interested.
