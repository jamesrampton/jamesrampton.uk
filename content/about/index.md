Hi, I'm James. Nice to meet you.

I'm a web developer, specialising in bespoke back-office systems and API integrations with Django.

I have a background in Government communications, so I enjoy proofreading and copy editing when I need some time away from code.

I'm also a photographer and musician; you can find some of my work dotted about this site.

My most recent sound design project was a collaboration with [Alan Jackson](https://speakersonstrings.com/wedo.html) for [Andy Baker](https://andybak.net)'s VR Kinetic Sculpture, *[Gossamer](https://andybak.net/gossamer)*. It's on display at the [Museum of Other Realities](https://www.museumor.com/artwork/gossamer). Alan and I created the soundtrack, and I assisted with the audio implementation in Unity.

Working for Government, I was Director of Photography, Camera Operator, and Voice Over Recordist for a short information film on [Anti-Social Behaviour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ADc-r4ub0).

I'll occasionally [write](/posts) here on subjects ranging from the above interests to anything else that tickles my fancy.

This site was hand built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), if you're interested.
